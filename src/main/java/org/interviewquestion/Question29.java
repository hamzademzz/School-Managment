// ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Array stores element in contiguous memory location while linked list stores at random places, this means linked list better utilizes the places.
// ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;Consequently, its possible to have large linked list in limited memory environment compare to array of same size.
// Advantage of using array is random access it provides if you know the index, while in linked list you need to search an element by traversing which is O(n) operation.
